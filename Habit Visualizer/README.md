Habit Visualizer App

Welcome to the Habit Tracker App, a simple tool designed to help you stay on top of your habits. This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version, so it’s all about getting the basics right: adding habits, tracking them, and seeing your progress through a fun visualizer.

Features:
Add Your Habits: Create a list of habits you want to track. Whether it’s working out, meditating, or calling family, it’s up to you.

Log Your Progress: Select a habit, mark it as completed, and watch it come to life in the visualization.

Real-Time Visualization: Your habits are represented as bouncing circles on a canvas—simple but satisfying.

User Accounts: Log in or sign up to save your habits and progress. Everything is securely stored in the cloud using Firebase.





This app is just getting started. Here’s what I’m planning for future versions:

More Dynamic Visuals: Instead of bouncing circles, imagine a pond that fills with fish every time you log a habit. The fish grow, multiply, or even swim around based on your consistency.

Detailed Analytics: See streaks, progress charts, and habit trends over time.

Customization: Choose different themes for the visualizer—gardens, forests, oceans, and more.



Sign Up or Log In: Create an account to save your habits and progress.

Add Habits: Click "Add Habit," type in what you want to track, and save it.

Log a Habit: Select a habit from your list, click "Visualize Habit," and see it pop into the visualization.

Delete Habits: Don’t need a habit anymore? Select it and click "Delete Selected Habit."


ReactJS: Handles the frontend.
Firebase: Manages authentication and stores your habits.
CSS: For styling the app.


Known Issues
Visualization is currently limited to circles.
Advanced features like analytics and habit streak tracking are still in the pipeline.


Why I Built This
I wanted a simple, no-frills habit tracker that shows progress over time.  The app is meant to be free, simple, and easy to use.
